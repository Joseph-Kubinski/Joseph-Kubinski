- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joseph-Kubinski
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I can to become a well-balanced full stack developer. I am currently serving in a leadership role in the USAF. I want to transition into a developer in about a year. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, javascript, React, Postgres, and Django!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything! I am looking to learn. Looking to develop self learning habits and reachout if I need help.
